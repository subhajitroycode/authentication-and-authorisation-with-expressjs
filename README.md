# Authentication vs. Authorization in User Deletion Functionality

## Overview

This document discusses the security implications of implementing user deletion functionality based solely on authentication, and explains why both authentication and authorization are crucial for maintaining a secure system.

## Analysis

### Is this a good idea?

No, this requirement is not a good idea when considering the principles of secure application design. It conflates authentication with authorization, which are two distinct and crucial concepts in cybersecurity.

### Authentication vs. Authorization

#### Authentication
- Definition: The process of verifying who a user is.
- Key Question: "Are you who you claim to be?"
- Methods: Credentials (username/password), biometrics, multi-factor authentication, etc.

#### Authorization
- Definition: Determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
- Key Question: "Are you permitted to perform this action?"
- Methods: Checking user roles, permissions, or access levels after authentication.

### Why the Requirement is Problematic

1. Lack of Granular Control: Allows any authenticated user to delete any other user's account.
2. Violation of Principle of Least Privilege: Gives excessive permissions to all users.
3. Potential for Abuse: Malicious users could cause widespread damage.
4. Inadequate Data Protection: Fails to protect sensitive user data from unauthorized actions.

### A Better Approach

Implement both authentication and authorization:
1. Authentication: Verify the user's identity.
2. Authorization: Check if the authenticated user has specific permission to delete user accounts.
3. Action: If both checks pass, allow the delete action.

Implementation suggestions:
- Define user roles (e.g., admin, regular user)
- Assign permissions to roles (e.g., only admins can delete users)
- Check permissions before allowing sensitive actions

## Conclusion

While authentication is crucial for securing an application, it's not sufficient on its own for controlling access to sensitive functions like user deletion. Implementing both authentication and authorization creates a more robust security model that protects against unauthorized actions, even from authenticated users. This approach aligns with cybersecurity best practices and helps maintain the integrity and security of the system and its users' data.
